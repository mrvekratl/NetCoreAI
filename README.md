# 🧠 NetCoreAI | .NET 8 + Artificial Intelligence Integrations  

### 20 Real-World AI Integrations with .NET | OpenAI | Google Cloud | Azure | OCR | TTS  

---

## 📌 About the Project  

**NetCoreAI** is a collection of **20 practical artificial intelligence integrations built with .NET 8 and C#**, developed as part of [Murat Yücedağ’s Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/csharp-net-ile-yapay-zeka-entegrasyonlari/).  

This project demonstrates how to seamlessly integrate **OpenAI, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, and Tesseract APIs** into .NET applications to build real-world AI-powered tools.  

Each mini project focuses on a specific AI capability — from **text generation, summarization, sentiment analysis**, and **translation**, to **speech recognition, OCR**, and **text-to-speech conversion**.  

My main objective was to go beyond theory — to understand **how AI APIs communicate with backend systems** and how developers can design **AI-driven features** that are secure, efficient, and production-ready.
